Capstone_Final Project_Applied Data Science: The Battle of Neighborhoods
1.	Introduction
This project aims to utilize all Data Science Concepts learned in the IBM Data Science Professional Course. We define a Business Problem, the data that will be utilized, and using that data, we can analyze it using Machine Learning tools. 
This final project explores the best locations for Chinese restaurants throughout the city of New York. New York is a major metropolitan area with more than 8.4 million (Quick Facts, 2018) people living within city limits. 
Chinese immigration in the United States has a long and fraught history. Throughout the first half of the 19th century, Chinese manual laborers (predominately men) migrated to the West Coast, where they found employment in agriculture, mining, railroad construction, and other low-skilled jobs. The number of immigrants from China residing in the United States nearly doubled from 1980 to 1990, and again by 2000. Since then the population continued growing but at a slower pace.
The Chinese American population of the New York City metropolitan area was an estimated 893,697 as of 2017. New York City itself contains by far the highest ethnic Chinese population of any individual city outside Asia,  estimated  at  628,763   as  of        2017  [ United States Census Bureau.].
This report explores which neighborhoods and boroughs of New York City have the most as well as the best Chinese restaurants.
